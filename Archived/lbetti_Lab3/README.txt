Lab3Task1 has two methods - print2Darray to print a 2D array and print2DArrayList to print a 2D ArrayList.
Lab3Task2 has two methods - runningSum2DArray returns an array with the running sum in the specified direction and runningSum2DArrayList returns an ArrayList with the running sum in the specified direction
Lab3Task3 has the methods to represent the different ways to iterate over an ArrayList.

In all methods, to test these methods, you must edit the constructed arrays in each classes main method.
In Lab3Task1 and Lab3Task2, the main method constructs an int[][] array and an ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>. 
The int[][] array is edited by changing the numbers in the initialization.
The ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> is edited by changing the elements added to each row.
The last class has an ArrayList<Integer> constructed in the main method. This is edited in the same manner.
Note that the TAs told me I could do this by just editing the main method instead of reading from a .in file.
Also, it might be helpful to uncomment the print statements I have in the main methods. I commented these out since the instructions say to not add any extra print statements.


Thank you,
