This lab was designed to help us better understand how linked lists work and how to implement them. As well, we put
something new, linked lists, with something we already knew how to work with, arrays. Nevertheless, even though
we should be familiar with arrays by now, since in this case we had to store linked lists in the arrays, it was
challenging.

The lab was slightly ambiguous, so my interpretation of the lab was that the sequence array would store linked lists.
Any changes to the sequence such as clipping or transcribing would happen to the sequence array as well.

NOTE: When using command line, you must have the path of the testing file, for example, this is how I tested my code:

                        java DNAList.java <array-size> /Users/mzking/Downloads/CSC172/Testing.txt

NOTE: I used code from class for the List.java and LList.java, both of which are posted on BlackBoard.
